# testcaseInterview
this project base required on test interview purpose, although there a lot of mistake on the project itself.  thanks for the opportunity

#NOTE
to run this, i personally dont use migration to set up the database, so it need to run manually. No worries, it simple setup there, 

1. create database called "interviewtest" as it show in the configuration (database.js)
2. make dummy call on app.js routing for the models with model.sync() function and hit the API to create and resync the database
3. do the same for the rest of table

thank you
